### Buildscripts for Volumio System

Copyright Michelangelo Guarise - 2016

#### Requirements

```
git squashfs-tools kpartx multistrap qemu-user-static samba debootstrap parted dosfstools qemu binfmt-support qemu-utils
```

#### How to

- clone the build repo on your local folder  : git clone https://github.com/volumio/Build build
- if on Ubuntu, you may need to remove `$forceyes` from line 989 of /usr/sbin/multistrap
- cd to /build and type

```
./build.sh -b <architecture> -d <device> -v <version>
```

where switches are :

 * -b `<arch>` Build a full system image with Multistrap. 
 Options for the target architecture are **arm** (Raspbian), **armv7** (Debian 32bit), **armv8** (Debian 64bit) or **x86** (Debian 32bit).
 * -d `<dev>`  Create Image for Specific Devices. Supported device names:
             **pi**, **odroidc1/2/xu4/x2**, **udooneo**, **udooqdl**, **cuboxi**, **pine64**, **sparky**, **bbb**, **bpipro**, bpim2u, cubietruck, compulab, **x86**
 * -l `<repo>` Create docker layer. Give a Docker Repository name as the argument.
 * -v `<vers>` Version

Example: Build a Raspberry PI image from scratch, version 2.0 : 
```
./build.sh -b arm -d pi -v 2.0 -l reponame 
```

You do not have to build the architecture and the image at the same time. 

Example: Build the architecture for x86 first and the image version MyVersion in a second step:
```
./build.sh -b x86

./build.sh -d x86 -v MyVersion
```

### armbian-based images

In case of lacking native support in volumio there is the option to build
images based on Armbian ( www.armbian.com ) which supports a variety of
PI clones - 

Example:

```
./build.sh -b arm -d armbian_bananapipro_vanilla -v 2.0
```

where

* armbian_ prefix is used to indicate the use of armbian
* boardtype in the notation of armbian
* _vanilla as postfix for mainline kernel or _legacy for android kernel

#### armbian kernels

please see notes in armbiam community which kernel is the best - or
if there are any restrictions that apply in your case
e.g. some mainline kernel still do not have stable ports of all devices, e.g. ethernet driver, while legacy kernel may miss other features.
In all cases even lecagy kernels come with overlayfs and squashfs support.

sucessfully tested images:

* armbian_bananapi_legacy
* armbian_bananapipro_legacy
* armbian_cubieboard2_legacy
* armbian_cubietruck_legacy
* armbian_bananapi_vanilla
* armbian_bananapipro_vanilla
* armbian_cubieboard2_vanilla
* armbian_cubietruck_vanilla

#### notes and known issues armbian

* current sunxi bootloader version 5.25/armbian is not working, solved by explicitely using 5.23 (be careful with apt-get upgrade later on)
* Partition 1 has been changed from vfat to ext4 because armbian scripts are
using symbolic links
* kernel, ramdisk and squashfs may be larger compared to native support images due to extra packages required by armbian build routines

* armbian_orangepipc_legacy ... not booting

others may work at once or with minor adaptions
*
